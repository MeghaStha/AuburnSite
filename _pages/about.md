The [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:

  * end poverty
  
  * protect the planet
  
  * improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).

## About this site
This site is based on the open source [Open SDG](https://open-sdg.org/) platform.
    
Other countries or organisations wishing to reuse the Open SDG reporting platform are welcome to do so for free. The [Open SDG Quick Start Guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) gives technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.

## About the data collection process
The data collected and visualized on this platform is an integral part of a Ph.D. dissertation research project. For this project, we have selected seven out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to focus on. The selection of these goals was based on an interest survey conducted as part of the same dissertation research. The survey aimed to gather information on which SDGs the residents of Auburn and Opelika value the most. We hope that the data presented on this website will be useful for policymakers, researchers, and anyone interested in promoting sustainable development. Thank you for visiting our website, and please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or feedback.

## Limitations of this study
A single researcher conducts the study, as opposed to cities, states, or countries themselves. While the findings of this study provide useful insights into the problems and potential of reporting on the SDGs at the level of small cities, care must be taken when extrapolating the findings to other contexts. In addition, the analysis revealed a lack of data at the municipal level for certain of the SDGs, making it impossible to accurately report on these targets. This constraint may have affected the findings' accuracy and completeness. Despite efforts to collect data from numerous sources, certain indications remained unreported due to a lack of available data. This underscores the need for more accessible and publically available data sources to support more accurate and thorough reporting on the SDGs at the level of small cities. In addition, the analysis uncovered disparities in reporting criteria between the United Nations and Auburn City, necessitating adjustments to some of the metrics. These alterations may have altered the comparability of the results with those from other cities or areas. While efforts were made to alter the reporting of the indicators to conform with UN standards, discrepancies in reporting standards may have led to variation in the results. To maintain uniformity in reporting, additional efforts are required to standardize data collection and management standards across areas. The data analysis was reliant on the researchers' interpretation, which may have added subjectivity and bias into the results. Despite efforts to reduce bias, subjective interpretations of the data may have affected the results. Future study may benefit from recruiting numerous researchers to independently assess the data in order to reduce the influence of bias. Lastly, the study lacked a control or comparison group against which to evaluate the findings, which may have hindered the capacity to make conclusive conclusions regarding the efficacy of the open SDG data reporting platform. Future research could benefit from the inclusion of a control or comparison group to help provide a benchmark against which to compare the findings.
